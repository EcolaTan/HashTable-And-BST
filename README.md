# HashTable And BST
- Comparison of 2 different custom hashtables and bst
- The binary tree is an AVL tree
- The first hashtable uses the default python hash function and uses linear probing for collisions
- The second hashtable uses the CRC32 hash function and uses quadratic probing for collisions
